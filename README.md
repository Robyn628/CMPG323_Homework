# CMPG323_Homework Development

This code tackles the problem of sorting different data in a database, it allows us to organise data in a more effic ient manner as well as to learn what is the best interface for users to manage. I enjoyed C# the most as the interactive interface made it much more enjoyable to see what exactly i was coding for other users.
